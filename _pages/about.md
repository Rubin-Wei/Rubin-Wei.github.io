<!-- ## <a id="aboutme"></a>About Me -->

I’m a first-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at the [School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/) in the [Language Understanding and Machine Intelligence Algorithms (LUMIA) Group](https://lumia-group.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.E. in Information Security from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).


My research interests lie in machine learning and large language models (LLMs), particularly in:
- Memory-augmented LLMs — training long-term memory to retain the entire training dataset  
- Parametric retrieval architectures for efficient and adaptive knowledge access  
- Decoupling common and factual knowledge within LLMs  

I’m always open to discussions and collaborations — feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat!
